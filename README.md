🂡 Blackjack AI Agents with Reinforcement Learning
A Python project using reinforcement learning to train two agents to play Blackjack against a dealer using a modified OpenAI Gym environment.

🚀 How to Run
To start the simulation:

-> python agent.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to configure and run the agents.

📁 Project Files
agent.py
Entry point of the project. Prompts user input to run and evaluate agents.

blackjack.py
A customized OpenAI Gym environment that supports two agents playing simultaneously against a dealer.

BlackjackAgent.py
Contains implementations of two reinforcement learning algorithms used by the agents to learn optimal strategies.

record_episode_statistics.py
A modified Gym wrapper for tracking and recording agent performance metrics during training.

🧠 Project Goal
To experiment with reinforcement learning in a multi-agent, probabilistic setting like Blackjack, and to evaluate the effectiveness of different training strategies.
